// i will write code here 
// this will be a base syntax, no need to worry about syntax as of now

// const is keyword for declaring variable

// Tasks is variable name which is storing this html code (h2 tag...)
// Tasks we can give any name, not nessesary to give exact name as file name, but mostly we give same as file name and Capitale first letter

// so we have to export at the end so other files can use it inside their code
const Tasks = () => {
